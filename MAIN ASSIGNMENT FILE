#### UBER ASSIGNMENT ####
#Loading the required packages
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)


#Getting uber request data into R
Uber.Request<-read.csv("Uber Request Data.csv",stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

#Observing the structure of dataframe Uber.Requests                         
str(Uber.Request)
#or you can also have a glimpse of data frame using Uber.Requests
glimpse(Uber.Request)




####Handling data quality issues/Data Cleaning####

#checking for any duplicate rows
cat ('there are',(nrow(Uber.Request)-nrow(Uber.Request %>% unique)),'duplicate rows')
#there are 0 duplicate rows


# checking for any NA values in all columns, one after other

# checking for any NA values in column Request.id
anyNA(Uber.Request$Request.id)          # no NA's
# checking for any NA values in column 
anyNA(Uber.Request$Driver.id)           # NA's present
# checking for any NA values in column 
anyNA(Uber.Request$Pickup.point)        # no NA's
# checking for any NA values in column 
anyNA(Uber.Request$Status)              # no NA's
# checking for any NA values in column 
anyNA(Uber.Request$Request.timestamp)   # no NA's
# checking for any NA values in column 
anyNA(Uber.Request$Drop.timestamp)      # NA's present

# It looks appropriate to leave the NA's untouched as they 
# look valid in the columns Driver.id and Drop.timestamp the NA's
# in the respective columns are present when there is a value
# "no cars available" in column status

#checking for any spelling mistakes in categorical columns

#In column Pickup.point

unique(Uber.Request$Pickup.point)

# there are only two unique values "Airport" "City"  in column Pickup.point.There are no spelling mistakes

#In column Status
unique(Uber.Request$Status)

#there are only three  unique values Trip Completed,Cancelled,No Cars Available in column Status.There are no spelling mistakes


####Handling date and time columns Request.timestamp and Drop.timestamp which are read as type character####

##Request.timestamp##

#Parsing Request.timestamp and storing it in the column Request_Date

Uber.Request$Request_Date<- lubridate::parse_date_time(Uber.Request$Request.timestamp,orders = c("d/m/Y H:M","d-m-Y H-M-S"))

# checking if there are any NA's coerced because of invalid data values
(Uber.Request$Request.timestamp %>% is.na %>% sum) == (Uber.Request$Request_Date%>% is.na %>% sum)
#It gives TRUE means  NA's are not coerced.This also means there are no invalid data values in Request.timestamp

#spliting date fromm Request_Date and storing it in column Request.Date
Uber.Request$Request.Date<- as.Date(Uber.Request$Request_Date)

#spliting date form Request_Date and storing it in column Request.Time
Uber.Request$Request.Time<-format(Uber.Request$Request_Date,"%H:%M:%S")

#Extracting hours mins and sec from column Request.timestamp
Uber.Request$Request.hour<-lubridate::hour(Uber.Request$Request_Date)
Uber.Request$Request.minute<-lubridate::minute(Uber.Request$Request_Date)
Uber.Request$Request.second<-lubridate::second(Uber.Request$Request_Date)

#Dropping request_date column
Uber.Request$Request_Date<-NULL


#####Drop.timestamp#####

#Parsing Drop.timestamp and storing it in the column Drop_Date

Uber.Request$Drop_Date<- parse_date_time(Uber.Request$Drop.timestamp,orders = c("d/m/Y H:M","d-m-Y H-M-S"))

# checking if there are any NA's coerced because of invalid data values
(Uber.Request$Drop.timestamp %>% is.na %>% sum) == (Uber.Request$Drop_Date%>% is.na %>% sum)
#It gives TRUE means  NA's are not coerced. This also means there are no invalid data values in Drop.timestamp

#spliting date form Drop_Date and storing it in column Drop.Date
Uber.Request$Drop.Date<- as.Date(Uber.Request$Drop_Date)

#spliting date form Drop_Date and storing it in column Drop.Time
Uber.Request$Drop.Time<-format(Uber.Request$Drop_Date,"%T")

#Extracting hours mins and sec from column Drop.timestamp
Uber.Request$Drop.hour<-lubridate::hour(Uber.Request$Drop_Date)
Uber.Request$Drop.minute<-lubridate::minute(Uber.Request$Drop_Date)
Uber.Request$Drop.second<-lubridate::second(Uber.Request$Drop_Date)

#Dropping request_date column
Uber.Request$Drop_Date<-NULL

######DATA ANALYSIS#####

# Since Request.id and Driver.id are id or unique values there isn't much sense analysing them

#Analysing variable Pickup.point by plotting a bar chart on it (and looking for some insights)
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(Pickup.point))+geom_bar(fill="royalblue1")+annotate("text",x=c("Airport","City"),y=c(3450,3700),label=c("48%","51%"))
#The above plot shows that ,there isn't much difference between Airport and city pickup requests

#Analysing variable Status by plotting a bar chart on it (and looking for some insights)
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(Status))+geom_bar(fill="royalblue1")+annotate("text",x=c("Cancelled","No Cars Available","Trip Completed"),y=c(1400,2800,2950),label=c("19%","39%","41%"))
#The above plot clearly depicts that only 41% of the requests from city and airport gets completed and the remaining 59% trips either get cancelled or there is  no car availability 

#Analysing variable Request.hour by plotting a bar chart on it (and looking for some insights)
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(Request.hour))+geom_bar(fill="royalblue1")+annotate("text",x=c(7.2,19),y=c(500,550),label=("High Request Rate"))
#The above plot clearly depicts that there are high request rates from 5AM TO 10 AM and 5pm to 10 pm

#Analysing variable Drop.hour by plotting a bar chart on it (and looking for some insights)
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(Uber.Request$Drop.hour))+geom_bar(fill="royalblue1")
#The plot for Drop.hour mostly shows the same pattern as Request.hour.
#But here only those requests which are completed are included 
#remaining all are NA'S

#More information can be obtained by plotting request.hour,status and pickup points on different levels


#Plotting barchart on varriable pickup point for different levels of Trip Status 
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(Pickup.point,fill=Status))+geom_bar(position = "dodge")+theme_bw()
#The above plot  shows that about 30% of city requests gets   
#cancelled and for about 52% requests the cars are not available 
#and only 42% of all trip requests get completed

#THE ABOVE PROPORTIONS CAN BE KNOWN FROM THE FOLLOWING CODE

#ploting uber requests at different hours of day for both airport and city pickups
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(x=Request.hour,fill=Pickup.point))+geom_bar()+theme_bw()+facet_wrap(~Pickup.point)
#The above plot clearly shows that most of city pickup request are from 5am to 10 am 
#and most of the airport pickup requests are from  5pm to 10 pm

#ploting uber requests at different hours of day for different levels of Trip status
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(x=Request.hour,fill=Status))+geom_bar()+facet_wrap(~Status)
#The above plot depicts that most requests that get cancelled fall under 
#5AM TO 10AM  and that's also the peak city pickup request time slot.
#And most requests that have no availability of cars fall under the time slot
#5PM TO 10PM (17 to 22) and that's the peak airport pickup request time slot

#Drilling the  plot on both  Status and Pickup variables gives a lot more information
ggplot(Uber.Request,aes(x=Request.hour,fill=Status))+geom_bar()+theme_bw()+facet_wrap(Pickup.point~Status)
# the above plot clearly shows that most of the request gets cancelled 
#for city pickups from 5AM to 10AM and the cars are not available for
#airport pickups from (5PM to 10PM)
 

#From all the analysis it can be said that during early morning hours(5AM to 10AM) 
#there are high city pickup requests Of which 30% get cancelled
